# Oct-Cohort-Daily-Coding-Challenge
I am creating this group GitHub Repo for any students' from the Flatiron School's Online Data Science Bootcamp who want to work on daily coding challenges while preparing for, or going through job applications.  This is an opportunity to improve and show off your coding skills on a regular basis.

When applying for my first couple of job openings, I was sent coding challenges for two of the positions, and while I felt reasonably prepared to tackle the challenges, I was unprepared for what I would be asked for questions.  Since those challenge, I decided to spend extra time working on different coding challenges online, and I thought the best opportunity would be to put together a GitHub repo for myself, and share it with other members of my Data Science Cohort, so that they can add their own notebook to the repo, including their own solutions.  This way not only will their own work be showcased, but a prospective employer might be interested to look at how other students from the same cohort might approach the same problems.  It also allows us to continue collaborating and comparing our workflow and approach with each other.

I take responsibility for the quality of this GitHub Repo, as well as the questions and solutions that are posted.  However, I also encourage others to post their own questions and challenges to the Repo, and to make sure they identify themselves as the author of such challenges or solutions, so we know who has added certain questions.
