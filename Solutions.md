```python
import numpy as np

def list_prod(l):
    return [np.prod([a for a in l if a != i]) for i in l]

l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(list_prod(l))
```

It's always good to start off with some test cases. Let's start with small cases and see if we can find some sort of pattern.

* N = 1: [1]
* N = 2: [1, 1], [2]
* N = 3: [1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [2, 1]
* N = 4: [1, 1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 1, 1]

What's the relationship?

The only ways to get to N = 3, is to first get to N = 1, and then go up by 2 steps, or get to N = 2 and go up by 1 step. So f(3) = f(2) + f(1).

Does this hold for N = 4? Yes, it does. Since we can only get to the 4th step by getting to the 3rd step and going up by one, or by getting to the 2nd step and going up by two. So f(4) = f(3) + f(2).

To generalize, f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2). That's just the Fibonacci sequence!

Of course, this is really slow (O(2<sup>N</sup>)) â€” we are doing a lot of repeated computations! We can do it a lot faster by just computing iteratively:

Now, let's try to generalize what we've learned so that it works if you can take a number of steps from the set X. Similar reasoning tells us that if X = {1, 3, 5}, then our algorithm should be f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 3) + f(n - 5). If n < 0, then we should return 0 since we can't start from a negative number of steps.

This is again, very slow (O(|X| <sup> N </sup>)) since we are repeating computations again. We can use dynamic programming to speed it up.

Each entry cache[i] will contain the number of ways we can get to step i with the set X. Then, we'll build up the array from zero using the same recurrence as before:

This now takes O( N * |X| ) time and O( N ) space.

The official solution was posted by [Stephan](https://github.com/osterburg) in the group slack channel on Friday, April 12.  

```python
def solution(A, K):
    seen = set()
    for num in A:
        if K - num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

From [Danyal](https://github.com/DanyalAndriano) on Thursday, April 11 in the afternoon on slack, she came up with:

```python
import itertools
def solution(A):
    return any(sum(combination) == 17 for combination in itertools.combinations(A, 2))
    ```

I have not found any other solutions for this, but this is the exact solution I used for my coding challenge that I was given.  Please feel free to add your own options for solutions!

```python
def solution(A):
    count = 0
    heads = 0
    tails = 0
    for i in A:
        if i == 0:
            heads += 1
        else:
            tails += 1
    print("Total Heads: {}".format(heads))
    print("Total Tails: {}".format(tails))
    if heads > tails:
        return tails
    elif heads < tails:
        return heads
    else:
        return (heads + tails // 2)
    ```
